Just to name a few, they use power tools, brackets, channels, zip ties, a variety of nuts and bolts, hammers, and plexiglass to construct the robot. </p>

Business controls our external relationships with businesses, experts and outreach events, while also doing documentation and scouting for competition. They find places to spread the world of STEM, attract sponsors to support our team, invite experts over to give us tips, manage the Engineering Notebook, and get information about who could benefit us as an Alliance. Business members always try to keep track of our programming and building progress as well, so we can accurately recollect of what we have done. They fill the Engineering Notebook with great details about our team’s accomplishments and hope to inspire kids to do as great.</p>

          <p class="infotext animated fadeIn">For our Autonomous, our goal is to complete all four objectives and possibly even more. We can score a total of 80 points by first unlatching, sampling, then placing our marker, and finally parking (will be explained more in “The Structure” section). We try to program our autonomous to not run into another’s robot, so their and our robot can execute well. If our Alliance can’t sample, we also have a program that fits the time given to sample both. Doing this gives us another 25 points, equivalent to 5 minerals scored in the lander. Autonomous is key to winning the match, so we have our programs pass a 90% accuracy test.</p>

          <p class="infotext animated fadeIn">During Tele-Op, we have our two drivers and driver coach try to score as many points as possible. We have our robot take minerals from the crater, while also staying outside of the crater. It then goes up into the lander, being dropped from above (will be explained more in “The Structure” section). We can take either mineral and average about 7 minerals. We always aim for the lander, for the extra 3 points per mineral leverage. This way, we can score about 35 points during Tele-Op. This can mean the difference between a good team and a great team.</p>

We know that our robot must take time to latch back, but we also want to get the last couple we already have into the lander. Latching back is worth 50 points, a large portion of the score, so we always pay special attention and give extra time for it. Usually, we give about 15 seconds to get off the ground, so we don’t risk the loss. In large part, End Game is a race against time.</p>
