          <p class="infotext animated fadeIn">Founded in 1969, we celebrate our 50th anniversary of Accuracy Accounting. We started out as a small business in Los Angeles and quickly gained recognition from the local community. In 1975, our small city of Walnut invited us to do their taxes and help keep a record of all their expenses. By 1988, Los Angeles recognized us as one of the “Top 100” Businesses in the city. Soon, clients started to become successes and we were very satisfied with the large companies that we were able to help. But in 2012, we refocused our goal on something else: helping small businesses and individuals succeed. We now orient ourselves to become a supporter of unlocked potential instead of worrying about the larger, predominant companies.</p>
